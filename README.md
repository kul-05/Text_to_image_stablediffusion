# Text_to_image_stablediffusion
# Purpose: The script demonstrates the use of the Stable Diffusion model for generating images from textual descriptions.
# Libraries Used:
diffusers: For loading and running the Stable Diffusion model.
transformers: Typically used for natural language processing but also supports models like Stable Diffusion.
gradio: For creating interactive user interfaces, although not used directly in the script.
accelerate: For optimizing the performance on hardware like GPUs.
matplotlib: For displaying generated images.
torch: The PyTorch library, which provides support for tensors and deep learning models.
# Installation: 
The required libraries are installed using pip.
# Import Statements
Importing necessary modules from the installed libraries.
# Authorization and Device Configuration
Authorization Token: Required for accessing the pre-trained model from the Hugging Face Hub
# Model ID: Specifies the model version.
# Device Setup: Configures the device (typically a GPU) to run the model.
# Loading the pre-trained Stable Diffusion model with specified settings
I tried to develop a GAN using data to train it but it was not possible in these time constraints to train a good model from scratch using random data.
# Usage
When you run the code, you will be prompted to enter a text prompt. Once you have entered a text prompt, the Stable Diffusion Pipeline will generate an image based on the text prompt. The generated image will be displayed using matplotlib.
